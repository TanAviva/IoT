Best Practices for Optimising QVD Creation and Usage
Qlik QVD (QlikView Data) files are fundamental to efficient Qlik Sense development. As an MI Analyst, leveraging QVDs wisely can dramatically improve data load performance and memory/storage efficiency. Below we explore best practices – from incremental loading to compression and memory management – with practical tips (including our organisation’s approaches) to help you apply these optimisations in your work.

Why Use QVDs? – Speed and Efficiency Benefits
QVD is Qlik’s native binary data format for storing a table of data exported from Qlik. QVD files contain the in-memory representation of a Qlik table (often called a “RAM image”) and can be loaded directly into memory without transformation. This makes QVDs the fastest way to load data into Qlik – much faster than pulling from databases or text files. In fact, reading from a QVD can be 10–100 times faster than querying the original source data. Qlik’s engine automatically uses an optimized load mode when no transformations or filters are applied on a QVD, allowing the engine to just map the disk blocks straight into RAM. [qlikviewcookbook.com], [qlikviewcookbook.com] [community.qlik.com] [community.qlik.com], [community.qlik.com]
Beyond speed, QVDs also reduce repeated work and database load. By storing frequently used or slowly-changing data in QVDs, you avoid hitting source systems on every reload. Multiple apps can share the same QVD, ensuring consistency and lessening network/database traffic – one extraction from the DB populates the QVD, and thereafter apps read from the QVD cache. For example, if several Qlik apps need customer data, you can load it once from the SQL database into a QVD and have all apps read that QVD instead of each running the same query. This buffering of data in QVDs lightens the load on source servers and speeds up reloads overall. [community.qlik.com]
Storage Efficiency: QVD files are stored in a highly efficient manner. Qlik’s engine compresses data by storing each field’s distinct values only once (in a symbol table) and using pointers for repeats. This “de-duplication” often yields an in-memory size much smaller than the raw source. It’s common to see a raw dataset of, say, 2 GB shrink to ~200 MB in Qlik – a ~10:1 reduction – due to this columnar compression of repeated values. The more redundant the data, the better the compression ratio. In short, QVDs are very compact for typical business data (which has many repeated keys, categories, dates, etc.). This means storage and memory savings, as QVDs eliminate duplicate values. [community.qlik.com] [qlikviewcookbook.com], [qlikviewcookbook.com]
N.B.: QVDs achieve compression via Qlik’s data model structure, not via zip algorithms. In fact, a QVD file on disk is essentially the uncompressed memory layout of the table. This is by design: because a QVD is stored in the same structure as Qlik’s RAM, the engine can load it directly into memory “as-is”. There’s no decompression overhead on load. The trade-off is that QVD files themselves are not compressed on disk (they occupy about the same as they do in RAM). But thanks to the symbol-table approach, that RAM (and QVD) size is already minimized. [qlikviewcookbook.com], [qlikviewcookbook.com] [qlikviewcookbook.com]
Key takeaway: Use QVDs as intermediate storage for your data pipelines. They greatly accelerate reload times and save resources, especially when dealing with large or repeatedly accessed datasets. Below, we’ll dive into specific techniques – incremental loading, compression tricks, and memory management – to optimise QVD creation and usage.
Incremental Loading: Only Load What’s New
One of the most impactful optimisations is implementing incremental loads for growing datasets. Instead of reloading an entire table every time (which can be very slow for large data), an incremental load will append or update only new/changed records since the last reload, using a QVD to store historical data. This dramatically reduces load times and processing workload by avoiding re-processing old data on each run. [Qlik Sense...Practices]
How it works: The general pattern for an incremental load is:

Keep a QVD of the last full dataset. On first run, you do a full extract from the source and store it to a QVD. On subsequent runs, you use the QVD as the baseline.
Fetch only new or updated rows from the source (e.g. “WHERE LastModified >= last_reload_time”). Use a timestamp or an incremental ID (or similarly, last load record ID) to pull only data since the last execution. Many source tables have a ​_modified date_ or sequential ID that can assist. [community.qlik.com]
Load the existing QVD data into the app (this brings in all previously fetched history very fast from local storage). [community.qlik.com]
Combine the new data with the old data:

For purely appending datasets (e.g. log records that never change once written), you simply concatenate the new rows onto the existing ones. Qlik even offers a BUFFER (Incremental) load prefix for simple append-only files. [community.qlik.com]
If updates to existing records are possible, you’ll need to merge carefully. A common approach is loading new/updated rows from source, then loading the QVD with a WHERE NOT Exists(KeyField) to exclude any records that were updated (the new load will cover them). In other words, avoid duplicating keys that have changed. This technique forces a non-optimized load of the QVD (since a where clause is used), but that’s usually acceptable – it’s still far faster than pulling everything from the database. [community.qlik.com]
If deletions occur in the source, additional logic is needed (for example, identify deleted keys and remove them from the in-memory table after loading, maybe via an Inner Join with the current source keys). [community.qlik.com], [community.qlik.com]


Store the merged result back into the QVD, replacing the old QVD with an updated one for next time. Save the current reload timestamp for the next run’s “last reload time”. [community.qlik.com]

By doing this, each reload only processes the delta (new/changed data) from the source, which is typically much faster than reloading the whole table. The bulk of the data comes from the local QVD at disk speed. Qlik’s help describes this process as: “Load new or updated data from the database (slow but few records)... Load the rest from the QVD (many records but very fast)”. [community.qlik.com]
Example: Suppose you maintain a QVD with all transactions up to yesterday. Today you run an incremental script: it selects only transactions where Date = Today() from the SQL database (small query) and concatenates them with the transactions from the QVD (which provides all older data). Then it stores a new QVD. This way, the heavy lifting of historical data is just a quick QVD load. The result: a daily refresh that finishes in seconds rather than hours, since only one day’s data is fetched over the network.
Many colleagues find this useful for daily/weekly updating apps. In one discussion, a teammate described “an app... updated daily. I want to continue doing this but only adding the new data, leaving historical data untouched”, to preserve history and not re-pull it each time. Incremental loading addresses exactly that need. [How do I]
Tips for incremental loads:

Identify a change marker: You need a reliable way to query “what’s new.” Common markers are a timestamp column (LastUpdated, ModifiedDate) or an increasing surrogate key (like an auto-increment ID). Ensure your source can provide new records based on such a marker. [community.qlik.com], [community.qlik.com]
Use Qlik script variables for last load time. For example, store the last execution timestamp in a QVD or a script variable, and use it in the SQL WHERE clause for the next run. Update it at the end of a successful reload. [community.qlik.com]
Handle updates and deletes carefully: If records can change after first load, implement the “reload then deduplicate” pattern with Exists() or Join logic as shown in Qlik’s examples. Be aware that this will disable optimized load (because of the where/join), but Qlik notes even that “standard” load is still far quicker than a full DB pull. [community.qlik.com], [community.qlik.com] [community.qlik.com]
Test the logic thoroughly before relying on it in production. Check that no records are missed or duplicated by doing a full reload occasionally and comparing results.
Use QVD buffering for simple cases: Qlik’s BUFFER prefix can automate some incremental behavior for file-based sources (it automatically maintains a QVD and appends new data for text sources). However, for databases, BUFFER by itself won’t fetch new DB rows – you’d still need custom logic for that. So most often, you’ll script the incremental logic as above. [community.qlik.com], [qlikviewcookbook.com] [qlikviewcookbook.com]

When set up properly, incremental loading can cut reload times and database strain dramatically. Our internal best practices explicitly encourage using incremental loads to “update only new or changed data, reducing load times”. This approach is especially crucial for large fact tables or running in tight reload windows. [Qlik Sense...Practices]
QVD Compression and Data Volume Management
Although QVDs inherently store data efficiently, you can take additional steps to optimise the size of QVDs and their memory footprint in your app. Smaller QVDs mean faster loads and less memory usage. Key strategies include minimising data volume, leveraging Qlik’s compression behavior, and structuring data smartly.
Load Only Necessary Data: Review your data — do you really need every column and row in the QVD for your analysis? Often, removing irrelevant data is the simplest win. Our Qlik Sense Best Practice guide puts it plainly: “Minimize Data Volume: Load only the necessary data to improve performance. Filter out historical data [that isn’t needed]. Aggregate data where possible.”. In practice, this means: [Qlik Sense...Practices]

Field reduction: Drop fields that aren’t used in any visuals or calculations before storing to QVD. Each additional field consumes memory and adds to QVD size. For example, if you have a large fact table, do you need every text description field in the analytical app? Perhaps some can be omitted or moved to a separate lookup table. By storing only what you use, you both shrink the QVD on disk and reduce RAM usage when it’s loaded. [Qlik Sense...Practices]
Filter out old records: If your app only needs, say, the last 2 years of data for its dashboards, don’t carry 10 years in the QVD. Either don’t load older records from the source in the first place, or drop them before storing the QVD. Trimming the history to the relevant window can vastly reduce data volume (and you can archive older data in a separate QVD if needed for occasional use).
Pre-aggregate when appropriate: Sometimes detailed transaction-level data isn’t required at full granularity. For instance, if an app only shows monthly totals, you might aggregate the source to month level before storing it. Fewer rows = smaller QVD. (Be cautious to only aggregate when you know you won’t need the detail, or keep detail in a separate QVD for drilldowns.)

Reducing data up front not only saves space and memory, but also improves reload speed (less data to read/write). It’s essentially the “data minimisation” principle applied to Qlik development: include just what’s necessary for the task at hand. [Qlik Sense...Practices]
Understand QVD “Compression”: As noted, QVDs store data in Qlik’s columnar format where each field’s unique values are stored once. To make the most of this, you can sometimes manipulate data to increase redundancy (and thus improve compression). For example:

Split high-cardinality fields: A single timestamp field has high cardinality (virtually every value is unique down to the second). This is costly in Qlik – minimal repetition means minimal compression. If fine granularity is not needed, consider splitting a timestamp into Date and Time fields (or Date and an hourly bucket, etc.). This way “Date” will repeat many times and “Time” will repeat across days – likely each has far fewer unique values than the combined timestamp. This can significantly reduce memory. Trade-off: you lose the singular timestamp field, but if not needed as-is, it’s a worthwhile trade. [qlikviewcookbook.com]
Round or bucket continuous values: Similarly, a numeric field like an exact amount might have very few repeats. If exact precision isn’t crucial, rounding to a sensible decimal or bucketing into ranges can increase duplication. For example, trimming a “Latitude/Longitude” to 3 decimal places will cause values to repeat instead of each being unique.
Categorize free-text if possible: Free-text comment fields tend to be unique per row (thus heavy). Often you wouldn’t include such a field in a QVD used for analysis; if you do need textual data, sometimes categorising or coding it (e.g., tag transactions with a sentiment or category instead of carrying full text) can cut down the uniqueness. Again, only do this if it aligns with your use case – otherwise consider storing text fields in a separate QVD that’s loaded on-demand or into a lightweight app only when needed.

Ultimately, the highest impact compression tactic is simply eliminating unnecessary columns/rows, as discussed. The Qlik engine will automatically compress whatever remains in the QVD as much as possible. We saw earlier that QVDs often achieve ~10:1 size reduction from raw data by this symbol-table method. If your data is less compressible (e.g., lots of unique IDs), focus on whether those unique-heavy fields are truly needed. [qlikviewcookbook.com]
Beware of QVD bloat from unique fields: It’s worth noting that because QVDs don’t apply zip compression, a field with entirely unique values (like a GUID or Transaction ID) will occupy roughly the same space in the QVD as it did in the source. If you have a very large table with a couple of high-uniqueness fields that you seldom use, consider dropping those fields. You can always store them in another QVD or bring them in via an alternate route if absolutely necessary. Cleaning your data model in this way (sometimes called data minimisation) not only reduces storage, but also improves performance (less to join, less to calculate).
Our organisation strongly emphasizes these points. Developers are advised to load the smallest dataset that meets the need; this includes using where clauses to restrict data and aggregating or excluding fields early in the ETL process. The result is lean QVDs that are quicker to work with. [Qlik Sense...Practices]
Optimising QVD Load Performance (Optimized vs. Unoptimized Loads)
When loading data from QVDs into Qlik, it’s important to keep the loads optimized whenever possible. An optimized QVD load is one where Qlik can stream the QVD straight into memory without any per-record processing. This is extremely fast – Qlik can load millions of rows per second in optimized mode. A non-optimized (standard) load, on the other hand, occurs if you do certain operations during the load (like applying a WHERE filter, renaming fields, or doing calculations in the Load script). Non-optimized loads are still faster than loading from raw data, but they can be about 10x slower than optimized loads and also temporarily use more CPU/RAM during loading. [community.qlik.com] [qlikviewcookbook.com]
Avoiding unnecessary transformations on load: To stay in optimized mode, refrain from adding transformations in the LOAD ... FROM QVD statement. For example, this load is optimized:
Plain Textqvs isn’t fully supported. Syntax highlighting is based on Plain Text.Orders:LOAD * FROM Orders.qvd (qvd);Show more lines
Whereas this load would be non-optimized:
Plain Textqvs isn’t fully supported. Syntax highlighting is based on Plain Text.Orders:LOAD *,      1 as DummyFlagFROM Orders.qvd (qvd)WHERE Region = 'EMEA';Show more lines
Why? Because we introduced a WHERE clause and an extra calculated field. Any such row-level operation forces Qlik to unpack the QVD. According to Qlik’s documentation, operations that disable optimized load include filtering (where), mapping, calculated fields, etc.. [community.qlik.com]
Best practice: If you need to filter or transform the data, use a two-step approach:

First, do a pure optimized load of the QVD into a temporary table (loading all fields, no filtering).
Then apply transformations in a resident load from that temp table, and drop the temp table.

This way, the bulk data transfer is optimized, and you handle the extra logic in memory. For example, Qlik Support suggests: “Always ensure QVDs are loaded as optimized. If changes are required, apply them through a resident load... e.g., load from QVD into TmpTable optimized, then LOAD ... RESIDENT TmpTable with your WHERE or new fields, then DROP TmpTable.”. [community.qlik.com]
By following this pattern, you still avoid hitting external sources, and the initial load remains super fast. The subsequent resident load will take some additional time and memory, but since it’s all in-memory, it’s usually efficient (and you can drop the temp table to free memory after).
Implications for memory: An optimized QVD load brings data into RAM exactly as it was in the QVD. As noted, the in-memory size will equal the QVD size (1:1). However, if you trigger a non-optimized load, Qlik must deserialize the data. In doing so, certain data like numeric fields might temporarily expand (internally, Qlik may treat them as strings during transformation). This can cause a higher peak RAM usage during load – often about double the size of the QVD if many fields are affected. Once loaded, the data model may be re-compressed, but you needed extra RAM to get there. In a server environment with large datasets, maintaining optimized loads can be important to avoid heavy reload resource usage. [qlikviewcookbook.com]
Therefore, keeping loads optimized where possible is both a performance and a memory consideration. If you do need to filter a QVD (say you want only Region = EMEA data in this app), an alternative is to create a smaller QVD upstream that already contains only the filtered data. Then the app can load that QVD optimized. This shifts the filtering cost to the QVD creation step (perhaps in an incremental script or ETL process), not every application reload.
In summary:

Use raw QVD loads (no filtering) in your apps for maximum speed.
Apply any filters or adds via resident loads or by preparing specialized QVDs in advance.
Monitor your script logs: Qlik will indicate “qvd optimized” in the load progress for optimized loads. If you don’t see that, something in the script is forcing a standard load. Adjust accordingly. [community.qlik.com]

Our internal guidance reinforces this: “The recommended approach for loading QVD files is to always ensure they are loaded as optimized. If changes are required, do an optimized load to a temp table, then apply changes in a resident load.”. By adhering to this, we keep our reloads snappy and resource-lean. [community.qlik.com]
Parallelism and splitting QVDs: Another advanced performance idea is partitioning very large QVDs so they can be loaded in chunks (potentially concurrently). Instead of one huge QVD of 100 million rows, you might have 10 smaller QVDs (e.g. split by year or by business unit). You can then load only the partitions you need, or even trigger multiple loads in parallel (if using partial reload or multiple threads in Qlik’s QVD generator). The Qlik SaaS community has even automated splitting large QVDs to improve reload times. The concept is that smaller QVDs are more manageable, and if your app doesn’t always need all partitions, it can skip some. In client-managed Qlik Sense, loads are single-threaded per app reload, so you won’t load two QVDs truly simultaneously in one script – but splitting can still help by reducing memory spikes and focusing on what’s needed. [qlikviewcookbook.com]
Example: If your data model contains a monster QVD of all transactions from 2010–2025, but most dashboards use only recent years, consider breaking it into yearly QVDs. Your app might by default load the last 2–3 years (optimized loads on those smaller QVDs). If a user explicitly needs older data, you could have a conditional logic or a separate app for that. This strategy can improve reload duration and memory usage by not dragging in unnecessary partitions. It also helps with QVD maintenance – smaller files are easier to regenerate and replace.
Practical Tips and Internal Practices
To summarise and highlight some practical strategies for QVD optimisation, the table below compares key techniques and their benefits:



































Optimization TechniqueHow to ImplementBenefit and ImpactIncremental LoadingLoad only new/changed records since last reload; use a timestamp or key to filter source data, merge with existing QVD data, then store back to QVD [community.qlik.com], [community.qlik.com].Performance: Greatly reduces reload time (only a small delta query vs full extract) [Qlik Sense...Practices]. Minimises DB load and network I/O.Storage/Memory: QVD grows with new data but avoids reprocessing entire dataset. Memory use in reload is lower since fewer rows are handled at once.QVD Caching (Reuse)Extract static or common data to QVD once, then have multiple apps or reloads read from that QVD instead of querying source each time [community.qlik.com].Performance: Speeds up loads by leveraging fast QVD reads; avoids repeated expensive source queries [community.qlik.com]. Especially useful for reference tables or lookup data used in many apps.Storage: Saves source system resources; QVD on disk is an extra copy of data but typically worthwhile given reload speed gains.Minimise Fields & RowsBefore storing to QVD, drop unused columns; apply where clauses to exclude irrelevant records (e.g. old dates) [Qlik Sense...Practices]. Possibly aggregate data to lower grain if appropriate.Performance: Lighter data sets load faster from QVD and through the pipeline [Qlik Sense...Practices]. Less data to crunch means quicker calculations in app too.Storage/Memory: Directly reduces QVD file size and in-memory footprint. Eliminating extraneous data frees up RAM and disk.Optimized QVD LoadsAvoid transforms in the QVD load. Load QVD raw, then use a resident LOAD for any filtering or adding fields [community.qlik.com]. Alternatively, pre-create filtered QVDs.Performance: Maintains maximal QVD load speed (direct binary load). Ensures reloads benefit from 10× faster optimized loading [community.qlik.com]. Slight overhead for second step, but overall still efficient.Memory: Keeps engine from doing heavy unpacking during load, preventing extra RAM consumption [qlikviewcookbook.com]. More predictable memory usage.Partition Large QVDsSplit very large datasets into multiple QVDs (by date, region, etc.). Load only needed partitions in each context.Performance: Improves reload manageability – can skip loading chunks not needed for a particular analysis, reducing load time. In some architectures, allows parallel processing of partitions for faster overall reload [qlikviewcookbook.com].Storage: Slightly more overhead (multiple files), but each is smaller. Memory usage is lower when only a subset of partitions is loaded.
Organisational practices: In our company, we have institutionalised many of these best practices. For example, an internal “Qlik Sense Best Practice Guide” advises developers to use incremental loads and QVDs for intermediate storage to optimise performance. It even suggests a naming convention for QVD files – e.g., suffixes like _Extract, _Transform, _Agg, _Final – to identify their role in a multi-stage data pipeline. This is part of a QVD layer architecture: raw extracts in QVDs, transformed data in QVDs, aggregated results in QVDs, etc., which can then be consumed by apps. Adopting clear naming and structure makes it easier for the team to maintain and reuse QVDs across projects. [Qlik Sense...Practices]
We also ensure QVDs are stored on a fast shared drive accessible to the Qlik servers. In our case, that’s an AWS file share – the guide explicitly says “store QVDs on the AWS file share for fast data retrieval”. This avoids any network bottlenecks; Qlik’s engine reading from a local/high-speed disk means it can truly achieve those 100x faster loads. (In contrast, if a QVD were on a slow network location, it could become a bottleneck. As a rule, keep QVDs as close to the Qlik engine as possible – one Qlik expert noted that if you’re working across a slow WAN, you want the QVD on the same side as the app reload to avoid moving large files over the network.) [Qlik Sense...Practices] [qlikviewcookbook.com]
Monitoring and governance: One must also manage the QVD refresh process. Incremental pipelines rely on regular QVD updates. If a scheduled task that generates a QVD fails or is turned off, your dependent dashboards might quietly start showing stale data. We have learned to put checks in place. For instance, a few months ago a QVD load task was accidentally disabled for a few weeks, and an app was “still pulling the data from QVD” not realizing the QVD hadn’t been updated, resulting in out-of-date figures. We had to quickly switch that app to direct SQL and then re-enable the QVD flow. The lesson is to ensure robust scheduling and alerting around QVD generation. Always know when your QVDs last updated, and consider implementing fail-safes (such as the app falling back to live queries or at least alerting if data is too old). [Tanay Chow...ry in chat]
Another internal improvement was creating a dedicated QVD stream and reload tasks in our Qlik management console for all QVD generation jobs. This separated data reload logic from front-end apps. It means QVDs are produced in a central, controlled way (by the data team) and then business-user-facing apps simply consume them. This separation of concerns has helped with scalability and clarity – QVDs are treated as enterprise data assets. [MI Team]
Finally, always document QVD contents (what data it holds, date range, refresh frequency) and ensure your colleagues know where to find and how to use existing QVDs before creating new ones. Reusing a good QVD is better than duplicating effort.
Conclusion
By applying these best practices – incremental loading, careful QVD management, data minimisation, and optimised loading techniques – you can significantly boost your Qlik Sense app performance and efficiency. Expect faster reloads, less strain on sources, and leaner memory usage. In summary:

Use QVDs as accelerators: Cache data in QVDs to avoid repeat extraction; leverage QVDs’ lightning-fast load (up to 100× faster than queries). [community.qlik.com]
Load smarter, not harder: Implement incremental loads so each reload only processes new data. This keeps daily refresh times short and manageable. [Qlik Sense...Practices]
Trim the fat: Keep your QVDs as small as possible by excluding unused fields and records. Your apps will thank you with faster performance and lower memory demands. [Qlik Sense...Practices]
Maintain optimized loads: Whenever possible, let Qlik load QVDs in optimized mode for maximum speed. Do necessary filtering or transformations in a second step or upstream ETL to preserve that benefit. [community.qlik.com]
Plan your QVD architecture: Organise QVDs logically (by subject area, by data stage) and store them on fast storage. Monitor their refreshes. A well-structured QVD layer can become a solid foundation for all your MI reporting, enabling reusability and consistency.

By following these practices – many of which are already encouraged within our team – you’ll achieve better performance, efficient memory usage, and reliable, scalable Qlik apps. Each extra effort in optimising data loads pays off with snappier dashboards and happier end-users. Good luck, and happy Qlik-ing!
