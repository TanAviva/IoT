Here’s the most granular breakdown possible for both TVOC and ethanol index thresholds, using fine-grained intervals and UK English conventions. This version is designed to support detailed sensor calibration, environmental health analysis, or building automation logic.

| D1        | 226 – 250            | ~1.11 – ~1.22     | Borderline moderate; ventilation may be beneficial |
| D2        | 251 – 275            | ~1.23 – ~1.34     | Moderate; symptoms possible in sensitive groups |
| D3        | 276 – 300            | ~1.35 – ~1.47     | Upper limit of “Good”; approaching warning zone |
| E1        | 301 – 400            | ~1.48 – ~1.96     | Warning zone; odours and irritation may occur |
| E2        | 401 – 500            | ~1.97 – ~2.45     | Elevated VOCs; ventilation recommended |
| E3        | 501 – 600            | ~2.46 – ~2.94     | Moderate pollution; complaints likely |
| F1        | 601 – 750            | ~2.95 – ~3.68     | Poor air quality; symptoms expected |
| F2        | 751 – 1000           | ~3.69 – ~4.90     | Alert level; unsafe for prolonged exposure |
| G1        | 1001 – 1500          | ~4.91 – ~7.35     | High VOCs; urgent action required |
| G2        | 1501 – 2000          | ~7.36 – ~9.80     | Very poor; acute symptoms likely |
| G3        | 2001 – 3000          | ~9.81 – ~14.70    | Hazardous; evacuation or ventilation essential |
| H1        | > 3000               | > ~14.70          | Severe pollution; toxic exposure risk |

### 🍷 **Ultra-Granular Ethanol Index Thresholds and Descriptions**

| **Level** | **Ethanol Index Value** | **Description** |
|-----------|--------------------------|-----------------|
| A1        | 0.00 – 0.05              | Baseline; no ethanol detected |

Would you like me to generate similar granular tables for formaldehyde, PM2.5, or CO₂ thresholds? Or perhaps a crosswalk comparing these levels to WELL, RESET, or LEED building standards?
