Focus: The Meta (formerly Facebook) Engineering blog is a technical news resource for engineers interested in how Meta solves large-scale technical challenges. It covers the breadth of Meta‚Äôs platforms ‚Äì Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, etc. ‚Äì so topics range from backend infrastructure and storage systems to machine learning, AI, AR/VR, and front-end engineering. There is a strong focus on distributed computing, data management, and system performance needed to serve billions of users. [hojaleaks.com] [dev.to], [index.dev] [index.dev]
Why it‚Äôs useful: Meta‚Äôs services operate at a unique scale (Facebook alone has ~3 billion users), so the blog is full of lessons on designing ultra-large systems. You‚Äôll find posts about scaling social graph databases, caching systems (e.g. Facebook‚Äôs famous memcache infrastructure), and consistency challenges across globally distributed data centers. Meta‚Äôs engineers often share innovative approaches they‚Äôve developed ‚Äì for example, the blog has covered Shard Manager for scaling services (automatic sharding and load balancing), and Async workflows at Facebook scale (handling asynchronous jobs for billions of requests). Meta also frequently open-sources tools; the blog discusses projects like Presto (distributed SQL engine) and how they run it at Meta‚Äôs scale, with ten years of learnings. This real-world experience in scaling data queries, or building systems like TAO (Facebook‚Äôs distributed datastore), offers valuable architectural patterns for reliability and efficiency. [highscalability.com]
Notable Posts/Series:

Scaling Memcache at Facebook ‚Äì A classic Meta engineering article (archived on other sites) describing how Facebook scaled out its gigantic caching tier to support ever-increasing read load. It explains techniques like consistent hashing and regions, which are key system design concepts.
Shard Manager: Dynamic Sharding at Scale ‚Äì Post about Meta‚Äôs internal tool Shard Manager for automatically splitting and migrating service load across servers as usage grows. This illustrates how Meta handles partitioning of services and data in response to growth, a crucial aspect of system design for scalability.
(Open Source Highlights) ‚Äì Many Meta blog posts announce major open-source releases, which double as deep-dives into those systems‚Äô design. For example, posts on Facebook‚Äôs GraphQL, RocksDB (storage engine), or Prophet (time-series forecasting) detail the problems these systems solve and design decisions made. These give a window into cutting-edge solutions for complex workflows and data processing (often directly applicable outside Meta).

Key themes include scaling a website from a monolith to microservices, managing data pipelines and machine learning, and Airbnb‚Äôs contributions to the open-source community. [index.dev], [index.dev]
Why it‚Äôs useful: Airbnb is known for solving architecture challenges in a fast-growing startup-turned-enterprise environment. Their blog provides a candid look at transitions in architecture ‚Äì for example, Airbnb detailed its migration from a monolithic Ruby on Rails app to a service-oriented architecture (SOA) around 2020. They discuss the benefits (faster development, independent deployment) and the new issues that arose (service management, data consistency), which is invaluable knowledge for anyone designing evolving systems. Airbnb‚Äôs engineering team has also innovated in the workflow orchestration space. Notably, they created Apache Airflow, now a popular open-source platform for scheduling and managing complex data workflows. In fact, Airflow was born out of Airbnb‚Äôs need to handle an ‚Äúever-growing number of complex workflows and data pipelines‚Äù beyond what cron could manage. The blog often covers such data infrastructure: how they ensure data reliability, perform A/B tests at scale, or build their streaming and batch data lakes. Additionally, Airbnb writes about open-source projects (like Airflow, Apache Superset for BI, etc.), demonstrating design solutions that readers can adopt. Overall, the Airbnb tech blog is a rich resource on designing for scalability and agility in a modern cloud-native setup. [index.dev]
Notable Posts/Series:

Service-Oriented Architecture at Airbnb ‚Äì A series of posts on breaking the monolith. Airbnb engineers share why and how they split services, the challenges of distributed systems (e.g. debugging across many services), and tooling they built to manage the SOA. This offers practical insight into modular system design and organisational impact.
Airflow: Data Workflow Management ‚Äì Though originally introduced on Airbnb‚Äôs blog in 2016, Airflow has a dedicated page now. Still, Airbnb‚Äôs posts (and conference talks) about Airflow‚Äôs design explain how to use directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to reliably orchestrate tasks. It‚Äôs a classic example of solving complex workflow scheduling in a reusable way. The fact that Airbnb open-sourced Airflow and nurtured it into an Apache project underscores the blog‚Äôs value: it doesn‚Äôt just tell you what they built, but why and how ‚Äì knowledge you can apply to your own big data pipelines.

üëâ Link: Airbnb Engineering & Data Science Blog ‚Äì Stories on scaling the Airbnb platform, from infrastructure to machine learning.
LinkedIn Engineering Blog
Focus: LinkedIn‚Äôs engineering blog covers how the professional network builds and scales a platform connecting hundreds of millions of users globally.

[index.dev]
Why it‚Äôs useful: LinkedIn has contributed some fundamental building blocks of big data architecture ‚Äì most famously Apache Kafka, the distributed streaming platform. LinkedIn‚Äôs blog (and engineering pages) recount how Kafka was developed in-house around 2010 to handle the site‚Äôs activity stream and operational metrics. Today Kafka remains ‚ÄúLinkedIn‚Äôs central data pipeline‚Äù, handling over 1.4 trillion messages per day across 1400+ brokers. By following LinkedIn‚Äôs posts, you gain insight into designing high-throughput, real-time data systems. The blog also covers LinkedIn‚Äôs search and feed systems, which must provide personalised results under heavy load, and stream processing (LinkedIn‚Äôs use of frameworks like Samza and Flink). Additionally, LinkedIn discusses system design challenges like consistency across services, online-offline data integration (their Venice project is a database for online features built from offline data), and A/B testing at scale. They emphasize trade-offs and best practices ‚Äì for example, how to maintain reliability and low latency when your system scales to millions of qps (queries per second). LinkedIn's approach to data infrastructure and system design is highly instructive for anyone interested in big data architecture. [engineerin...nkedin.com]
Notable Posts/Series:

The Evolution of Apache Kafka at LinkedIn ‚Äì Posts (and talks) detailing how LinkedIn produced Kafka and scaled it over the years. For instance, an article from 2016 ‚ÄúKafka Ecosystem at LinkedIn‚Äù notes that Kafka was by then the backbone for LinkedIn‚Äôs data, and emphasizes why Kafka‚Äôs durability and low latency were key to LinkedIn‚Äôs architecture. It‚Äôs a real-world use case of a pub/sub system in a large enterprise. [engineerin...nkedin.com]
Scaling LinkedIn‚Äôs Feed and Search ‚Äì LinkedIn engineers have shared how they redesigned the feed backend to incorporate ideas like online batch processing (Lambda architecture) and how they scale the graph search that underpins people/professional search. These posts illustrate end-to-end system design: from data ingestion, through storage (LinkedIn developed Espresso, a distributed database, also featured on their blog), to the user-facing API.
Data Infrastructure & AI ‚Äì A recurring theme is how LinkedIn‚Äôs data team manages the flow of data for features like ‚ÄúPeople You May Know‚Äù or job recommendations. They have posts on their ML pipelines and feature stores, which are great for understanding how to productionise machine learning in a big-data context.

üëâ Link: https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog ‚Äì Explores technical challenges and solutions behind LinkedIn‚Äôs platform. [index.dev]
AWS Architecture Blog
Focus: Amazon Web Services‚Äô Architecture Blog is somewhat different from the product-centric AWS news ‚Äì it specifically shares cloud architecture best practices, patterns, and case studies drawn from Amazon and AWS customers. Topics include scalable cloud application design, serverless architectures, big data solutions, DevOps, and reliability engineering on AWS. [netmidas.com], [designgurus.io]
Why it‚Äôs useful: This blog is a treasure trove of reference architectures and prescriptive guidance for designing systems with high scalability and availability. Even though it‚Äôs AWS-oriented, the patterns (like event-driven microservices, CQRS, etc.) are cloud-agnostic concepts you can apply anywhere. The blog often features hands-on architectural discussions: for example, how to structure a multi-region active-active deployment, or how to use services like S3, DynamoDB, and Kafka (MSK) together to build a data pipeline. There are also case studies from various industries ‚Äì e.g. how Netflix (on AWS) achieves reliability, or how fintech companies design for security and scale ‚Äì which are effectively system design war stories. Additionally, AWS‚Äôs well-architected framework is reflected in many posts, teaching trade-offs around consistency, fault tolerance, cost optimisation, and performance. This makes it a great resource to understand the practical implementation of system design principles in the cloud.
Notable Posts/Series:

Architecture Patterns ‚Äì Many posts introduce a generic pattern with an example. For instance, ‚ÄúUsing event sourcing to handle distributed transactions‚Äù might show an architecture with Amazon Kinesis (stream) and Lambda, explaining how to ensure data consistency without a monolith. Another popular series is on Serverless Microservices, demonstrating how to orchestrate complex workflows with AWS Step Functions (a workflow engine), which parallels what one might do with custom orchestration frameworks in other contexts.
Scaling & Resilience Case Studies ‚Äì Posts like ‚ÄúScaling to millions of requests using Amazon DynamoDB‚Äù or ‚ÄúOptimising throughput for IoT workloads‚Äù provide concrete numbers and diagrams. These are excellent for learning how to pick the right database or messaging system for a given scale. The blog also revisits classic Amazon architecture lessons (often by Amazon‚Äôs own engineers), such as Werner Vogels‚Äô ‚ÄúEventually Consistent‚Äù approach in Dynamo ‚Äì though Vogels‚Äô personal blog (below) is where those originated, the AWS blog sometimes echoes those lessons for a modern cloud audience.

Independent & Community Engineering Blogs
These are well-regarded blogs or platforms not tied to a single company. They often synthesise experiences across many organisations or focus on fundamental principles of system design. They include personal blogs by technology leaders and community-driven sites. Many have ‚Äúclassic‚Äù posts that remain highly relevant.
High Scalability
Focus: High Scalability is a long-running independent blog focused on scalability, architecture, and system design topics across the tech industry. It‚Äôs known for its detailed architectural case studies of popular websites and services. The tagline of the site is ‚ÄúBuilding bigger, faster, more reliable websites‚Äù, which encapsulates its mission. [designgurus.io] [highscalability.com]
Why it‚Äôs useful: High Scalability provides an unparalleled archive of how various companies have scaled their systems. The blog often aggregates and summarises talks or write-ups from engineers at different firms, offering a one-stop resource to compare approaches. For example, you can find breakdowns of architectures for services like Twitter, Reddit, or Imgur, often titled like ‚ÄúHow X Works‚Äù or ‚ÄúScaling X: Lessons learned‚Äù. These usually outline the tech stack, data flow, and key decisions (caching, sharding, etc.) behind handling high load. High Scalability also covers general scalability patterns and best practices ‚Äì posts on topics such as caching strategies, CAP theorem, NoSQL vs SQL trade-offs, messaging queues, etc., which are extremely valuable for system design fundamentals. Many ‚Äúclassic posts‚Äù on system design interviews and patterns link back to High Scalability for reference. Moreover, the site stays updated with guest posts: e.g., it has recent contributions on current technologies (a Kafka 101 article in 2024, a case study of scaling Uber Eats, etc.). Importantly, it surfaces lessons from failures too. Reading a variety of case studies here widens your perspective on how different constraints (finance, team size, legacy systems) can influence architecture decisions. This big-picture perspective complements learning from any single company‚Äôs blog.
Notable Content:

Case Study Archives: High Scalability‚Äôs ‚ÄúAll Time Favorites‚Äù include write-ups like ‚Äú7 Scaling Strategies from Facebook‚Äù or ‚ÄúThe Architecture of Reddit‚Äù. These are distilled lessons from pioneers in web scalability, highlighting techniques like database sharding (Facebook‚Äôs early strategy), eventual consistency, or using CDN edge caching.
Articles on Principles: There are evergreen explanatory posts, such as ‚ÄúLatency vs Throughput‚Äù or ‚Äú8 Common Scalability Patterns‚Äù, which break down the theory behind system design choices in simple terms. These help solidify your conceptual understanding.
Guest posts on new tech: Often, engineers from various companies will republish content on High Scalability. For example, a Meta engineer‚Äôs article ‚ÄúLessons Learned Running Presto at Meta Scale‚Äù was featured, sharing four key learnings from operating a large distributed SQL engine for 10 years. Similarly, an Uber engineering director recapped ‚ÄúA Brief History of Scaling Uber‚Äù on the blog. This cross-pollination of content makes High Scalability a hub of industry knowledge beyond any single source. [highscalability.com]

All Things Distributed (Werner Vogels‚Äô Blog)
Focus: All Things Distributed is the personal blog of Dr. Werner Vogels, Amazon‚Äôs CTO, and it famously covers his thoughts on building scalable and robust distributed systems. Werner often uses the blog to discuss architectural philosophies behind AWS and Amazon‚Äôs own platforms, sometimes announcing new paradigms (like eventually consistent databases, serverless computing vision, etc.). It also features general musings on cloud trends and occasional guest posts.
Why it‚Äôs useful: Werner Vogels has been at the forefront of distributed system design (his work includes the Amazon Dynamo paper, which influenced the NoSQL movement). His blog gives you a direct line to the mindset of a chief architect of one of the biggest cloud infrastructures. Many posts are now considered classic reading for system design practitioners. For example, the 2007 post ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äôs Dynamo‚Äù (essentially a summary of Amazon‚Äôs Dynamo key-value store research paper) laid out how Dynamo achieves high availability and partition tolerance in a large-scale database. This post introduced concepts like eventual consistency and hinted at techniques (consistent hashing, replication, hinted handoff) that are now textbook material for distributed data stores. All Things Distributed also had early discussions on microservices vs monoliths from Amazon‚Äôs perspective, the notion of ‚Äúdistributed computing primitives‚Äù, and how to architect for failures (Werner‚Äôs famous quote: ‚ÄúEverything fails, all the time‚Äù is often cited from his talks and reflected in his writing). In recent years, Vogels has used the blog to highlight modern challenges and solutions, like the rationale for Amazon‚Äôs internal re-architecture of certain systems (e.g., the Prime Video team‚Äôs decision to rebuild a microservices product as a monolith for efficiency ‚Äì detailed in a 2023 post titled ‚ÄúMonoliths are not dinosaurs‚Äù). As such, the blog provides strategic insights into system design decisions at a high level, complementing hands-on technical blogs. It‚Äôs also a great place to learn about AWS design tenets without marketing fluff ‚Äì e.g., posts on the ‚Äúdistributed computing manifesto‚Äù behind AWS Lambda or DynamoDB give you the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù behind those services.
Notable Posts:

A Word on Scalability (2006) ‚Äì In this early post, Werner defines what scalability really means in practical terms (when adding resources yields proportional results). It‚Äôs a concise primer that dispels common misconceptions and is often referenced in academic settings.
Amazon‚Äôs Dynamo (2007) ‚Äì As mentioned, a seminal explanation of Dynamo, Amazon‚Äôs highly available datastore. This is a must-read to understand concepts like quorum reads/writes and the trade-offs Amazon made to achieve scale and fault tolerance (the learnings of which live on in systems like Apache Cassandra).
Eventually Consistent (2008) ‚Äì Werner‚Äôs explanation of why eventual consistency is not only acceptable but often the preferred approach in distributed systems. This post justified a departure from strictly ACID databases for massive scale, and it‚Äôs very useful for understanding modern NoSQL design.
Now Go Build Series ‚Äì In recent years, Werner occasionally shares videos and stories under ‚ÄúNow Go Build,‚Äù which highlight tech entrepreneurship and architectures in various startups globally. While not deep technical dives, they are inspiring and show how core principles of scalable design are applied in different contexts.
Monoliths vs Microservices ‚Äì A 2023 article on how Amazon Prime Video reverted from microservices to a monolith for a particular service (to improve performance and reduce complexity) sparked much discussion in the community. It‚Äôs a great case study in challenging assumptions ‚Äì reminding that ‚Äúmicroservices are not a silver bullet‚Äù and that architecture should fit the problem.

Byte Byte Go (Alex Xu‚Äôs System Design Newsletter)
Focus: ByteByteGo is an educational platform and newsletter created by Alex Xu (author of the popular System Design Interview books). The ByteByteGo blog/newsletter specialises in explaining complex system design topics in simple, visual ways. It covers everything from fundamental concepts (caching, sharding) to specific tech (Kafka, Kubernetes) and use-case-driven designs (e.g. how to design a URL shortener or ride-sharing system). Content often includes diagrams, animations, mind maps, and cheat sheets to break down systems architecture. [dev.to]
Why it‚Äôs useful: ByteByteGo has quickly become a go-to resource for engineers preparing for system design interviews or just looking to strengthen their architecture skills. Unlike the company blogs that detail what a specific company did, ByteByteGo focuses on teaching patterns and concepts in a very digestible format. For example, a typical ByteByteGo issue might illustrate the internals of a load balancer or compare different database sharding strategies with friendly graphics. The explanations assume minimal prior knowledge and build up a mental model that you can apply to various scenarios. This makes it a great starting point for complex topics ‚Äì you get the high-level view and terminology, which you can then deepen by reading the more technical blogs or papers. ByteByteGo also stays current with industry trends; recent newsletters have tackled things like distributed caching with Redis, designing real-time collaborative editing (like Google Docs), and the architecture of modern large-scale systems (sometimes drawing on public talks from Google, Meta, etc., but summarising them succinctly). Because it‚Äôs delivered as a weekly newsletter, it‚Äôs regularly updated and pulls in knowledge from across the tech world. In short, ByteByteGo is useful for learning system design (with a pragmatic, interview-oriented slant), complementing the doing/experiencing perspective you get from the other blogs.
Notable Content:

Visual System Design Guides: ByteByteGo often produces one-page visual guides ‚Äì for instance, ‚ÄúSystem Design Blueprint‚Äù mind maps that outline all components one might consider (client -> load balancer -> server -> DB -> cache -> etc.). These are excellent revision material and help ensure you don‚Äôt miss elements when designing a system.
Real-World Case Studies (Visualised): Some posts take famous architectures (like Netflix or Uber, as discussed in their official blogs) and summarise them in a simplified diagram with commentary. This can be a quick way to grasp the essence of those case studies before diving into the full text.
Top N Lists and Comparisons: Alex Xu‚Äôs team also shares curated lists (much like this one!) and comparisons ‚Äì e.g., ‚ÄúTop 9 engineering blogs‚Äù, or comparisons of similar technologies (SQL vs NoSQL illustrated, different message queue systems, etc.). This curated approach helps identify quality resources and tools in the vast landscape of system design info.

In Summary: The engineering blogs above are excellent pathways to mastering system design, big data architecture, and complex workflow management. By regularly reading these, you‚Äôll gain exposure to how top engineers solve real-world problems at scale ‚Äì from streaming video to ride-hailing to massive social networks. For example, you can learn how Netflix optimises microservices for streaming, how Uber processes geospatial data in real-time, how Meta handles billions of interactions with a distributed infrastructure, and how platforms like High Scalability distill the lessons from all of them. Many of these blogs also have archives of classic posts (some referenced above) that remain relevant as ever. [index.dev]
Keep in mind that the true value comes from not just reading, but reflecting and applying these insights. Try to connect the patterns you read about with design challenges you encounter in your own work. Over time, you will build a arsenal of approaches for designing reliable, scalable systems. Whether you‚Äôre preparing for an architecture interview or building a new product, these blogs will serve as both an inspiration and a knowledge base. Happy reading, and may your systems be ever scalable and your workflows ever efficient! [netmidas.com]
