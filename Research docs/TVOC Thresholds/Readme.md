Understanding TVOC and Ethanol Index Thresholds for Indoor Air Quality
Indoor Total Volatile Organic Compound (TVOC) levels are commonly categorized into ranges (e.g. “Good”, “Moderate”, “Poor/Alert”) to gauge air quality. The example ranges you provided – Good: 0–300 ppb, Moderate: 301–1000 ppb, Alert: >1000 ppb – align with TVOC guidelines used in indoor air quality standards. These thresholds weren’t chosen arbitrarily; they stem from scientific research on human health/comfort and from regulatory or industry standards for indoor environments. Likewise, the “ethanol index >0.50” alert criterion is a sensor-specific metric related to VOC detection (ethanol is a common VOC proxy gas). Below, we’ll break down the basis for these TVOC ranges and the ethanol index threshold, including how different agencies and standards define “safe” vs “unsafe” VOC concentrations, and the health/environmental impacts underpinning them.
What TVOC Represents and Why It’s Measured
TVOC is the sum concentration of all detectable volatile organic compounds in air (usually expressed in mg/m³ or ppb). Because indoor air typically contains dozens of VOCs from various sources (paints, adhesives, cleaners, furnishings, people’s activities, etc.), measuring total VOC provides a convenient overall indicator of air quality. High TVOC means many VOCs are accumulating faster than ventilation can dilute them, which is often associated with odor, irritation, or health risks. Scientists like Mølhave et al. have shown that as total VOC levels rise, occupants report more irritation and “sick building” symptoms (headaches, eye/nose/throat irritation, etc.). Thus, authorities have proposed guideline concentrations to classify indoor air quality. [atmotube.com], [atmotube.com]
Origins of “Good/Moderate/Poor” TVOC Thresholds
The breakpoints around 300 µg/m³, 1000 µg/m³, 3000 µg/m³, etc. (which correspond roughly to 60 ppb, 200 ppb, 600 ppb in typical indoor VOC mixtures) come from well-known indoor air quality standards:


German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) – 5 IAQ Levels: Germany’s guidelines (2007) translate TVOC concentrations on a logarithmic scale into five indoor air quality levels. These levels were based on human sensory research and toxicological data. In UBA’s scheme, Level 1 (“excellent”) is <300 µg/m³, Level 2 (“good”) is 300–1000 µg/m³, Level 3 (“moderate”) is 1000–3000 µg/m³, Level 4 (“poor”) is 3000–10,000 µg/m³, and Level 5 (“unhealthy”) is 10,000–25,000 µg/m³. The rationale is that prolonged exposure to higher concentrations causes significant comfort complaints and potential health effects, so each step up warrants more urgent ventilation or remedial action. For example, UBA says <300 µg/m³ poses “no objections” (ideal), 300–1000 µg/m³ is “no significant concerns” (just routine airing recommended), but above 1000 µg/m³ there are “objections” or complaints likely, and intense ventilation is recommended or required as levels climb.

World Health Organization (WHO Europe) – IAQ Guidelines: WHO’s indoor air quality guidelines for Europe (2000) similarly classify TVOC levels into categories. WHO set a target guideline of <0.25 mg/m³ (250 µg/m³, ~50 ppb) as the long-term ideal. They consider 0.25–0.5 mg/m³ a typical indoor background, 0.5–1 mg/m³ “slightly increased (generally harmless)”, 1–3 mg/m³ “significantly increased” (only safe for temporary exposure), and >3 mg/m³ “greatly increased – not acceptable”. In other words, >1000 µg/m³ (1 mg/m³) in indoor air is viewed as a level where, if sustained, there is a risk of adverse effects, and >3000 µg/m³ should not be tolerated even short-term. These WHO levels were informed by clinical and comfort studies, aiming to prevent both irritation and longer-term toxicity. Notably, WHO’s “safe” bar (250 µg/m³) is quite low – reflecting a precautionary approach to protect the general population. [atmotube.com] [enless-wireless.com], [atmotube.com]


Other National Guidelines: Several countries have adopted similar ranges. For instance, an European collaborative report (ECA) and researchers like Mølhave have long suggested that around 200–300 µg/m³ is a threshold below which no irritation or discomfort is expected, whereas complaints become more common as levels approach 1000 µg/m³ and beyond. Austria’s Ministry of Health and other agencies echo the WHO values in classifying <0.25 mg/m³ as excellent and >1–2 mg/m³ as problematic. In practice, many national health agencies don’t legislate a single “TVOC limit” but issue guidance values or recommend using these international benchmarks. [enless-wireless.com]

(ppb values assume a typical indoor VOC mix; 1 ppb ≈ 4.9 µg/m³ for average VOC molecular weight.) [support.atmotube.com]
As shown, there is broad consensus that TVOC concentrations should remain below roughly 0.3–0.5 mg/m³ on average, and certainly below ~1 mg/m³ for continuous exposure. Once levels creep into the multiple mg/m³ range, the air is considered polluted enough to warrant immediate improvements (ventilation, source control). Your categories in ppb correspond to these same cutoffs: [atmotube.com] [enless-wireless.com]

0–300 ppb (~0–1.5 mg/m³) – this spans the Excellent/Good range of most standards (essentially “clean” air).
301–1000 ppb (~1.5–4.9 mg/m³) – this overlaps the upper end of “good” and into “moderate” air quality. By 1000 ppb (~4.9 mg/m³), we are well above most health-based guidelines (e.g. ~5× the WHO long-term target), which is why crossing this threshold triggers an Alert in your case.
>1000 ppb (>4.9 mg/m³) – this is clearly in the “poor” or “unhealthy” zone by any standard (far above what Germany, WHO, etc., deem acceptable). Sustained TVOC concentrations in this range indicate strong VOC sources (e.g. fresh paint, heavy solvent use, industrial products) and would likely cause acute symptoms for occupants. Hence the Alert classification and the need for immediate mitigation when this level is detected. [enless-wireless.com]

In practice, many manufacturers of air quality sensors and monitors have adopted these reference points to colour-code or alert on VOC readings. For example, Cisco’s Meraki IAQ sensor uses:“Excellent” <300 µg/m³, “Good” 300–1000 µg/m³, “Fair” 1000–3000 µg/m³, “Poor” 3000–10,000 µg/m³, “Inadequate” ≥10,000 µg/m³ – essentially the German five-level scheme. Your simpler three-tier scheme is just a condensed version (collapsing the first two as “Good” and everything above 1000 ppb as “Alert/Poor”). This simplification is common for ease of use: green, yellow, red zones. [documentat...meraki.com]
Health and Environmental Impacts Behind the Numbers
The TVOC thresholds are grounded in studies of how VOCs affect humans:

At low levels (<0.3 mg/m³): Typically no noticeable effects. This “Good” range is analogous to clean outdoor air or well-ventilated indoor environments. Even sensitive individuals are unlikely to experience irritation. It’s considered the background target for healthy buildings. [atmotube.com]
At moderate levels (~0.5–1 mg/m³): Some sensitive people might detect odors or mild irritation, but generally these concentrations are deemed acceptable for short periods. They act as a warning that ventilation should be increased or sources investigated before levels rise further. There is not usually an immediate health hazard at 0.5–1 mg/m³, but it suggests the indoor air quality is deteriorating. [atmotube.com]
At higher levels (1–3 mg/m³): This range is associated with more marked irritation and discomfort. Studies (e.g. in office environments) have found that complaints of headaches, dizziness, eye/throat irritation, etc., become more frequent when total VOCs exceed roughly 1 mg/m³ for any sustained period. Long-term exposure here is undesirable; standards say such concentrations should only occur temporarily, if at all. Occupants may begin to experience symptoms of Sick Building Syndrome – a collection of non-specific health issues linked to poor indoor air. [atmotube.com] [atmotube.com], [atmotube.com]
At very high levels (>3–5 mg/m³, i.e. >600–1000 ppb): Indoor air is considered “polluted” or unsafe. At these concentrations, even short exposure can cause acute symptoms. Common effects include eye, nose and throat irritation, coughing, nausea, and headaches. High VOC can exacerbate asthma or bronchitis and cause strong odors that indicate poor conditions. Some VOCs at these levels can have toxic effects on the central nervous system (causing dizziness or confusion). Prolonged exposure could lead to more serious long-term health risks: e.g. certain VOCs are carcinogenic or can damage the liver, kidneys, and nervous system with chronic exposure. In fact, epidemiological studies link long-term high-VOC exposure to increased risks of respiratory infections, allergies, and even cancers. This is why 3 mg/m³ is often treated as an absolute ceiling – above this, immediate action is advised. [environmen...expert.com] [support.atmotube.com], [environmen...expert.com] [enless-wireless.com]

It’s worth noting that “TVOC” is a lumped metric – it doesn’t tell us which specific compounds are present. The health impact of 1000 ppb of VOC can vary depending on whether those VOCs are relatively innocuous (e.g. ethanol or limonene from a cleaning spray) or highly toxic (e.g. benzene or formaldehyde from off-gassing). The thresholds are set deliberately conservative to account for this uncertainty – they assume that even moderate total levels could include some harmful chemicals. For example, formaldehyde is a VOC with its own strict limit (WHO recommends <100 µg/m³ for formaldehyde, and OSHA warns that as low as 0.1 ppm can cause irritation). If your TVOC is, say, 800 ppb, that might mostly be relatively low-toxicity solvents (causing odor and slight irritation), but it could also include a smaller amount of a dangerous VOC. Thus, keeping total VOC well below the “alert” level provides a safety margin. [support.atmotube.com] [atmotube.com]
Finally, environmental context: High indoor VOC levels also indicate poor ventilation and excessive chemical use, which can have secondary impacts (like contributing to smog precursors if vented outside). Many building standards (LEED, WELL) set VOC targets not just to protect health but to encourage use of low-emitting materials (paints, adhesives, furnishings) for sustainability. For instance, LEED and WELL Building Standard both require that indoor TVOC after construction/flush-out stays under 500 µg/m³ as a prerequisite for certification. This pushes builders to use materials and practices that keep VOC emissions low, benefiting both occupants and the environment. [atmotube.com]
The “Ethanol Index >0.50” – What Is It and Why Have a Separate Threshold?
Ethanol is a specific volatile organic compound often found in indoor air, especially due to cleaning agents, hand sanitizers, aerosol sprays, perfumes, and other solvent-based products. Many electronic VOC sensors actually use ethanol as a reference gas for calibration. This is because ethanol is common, well-characterized, and representative of how the sensor responds to a broad class of VOCs. For example, Sensirion’s SGP30/SGP40 MOX sensor (used in many IAQ devices) is factory-calibrated with ethanol and an ISO-standard VOC mixture; it shows similar sensitivity (“gain”) to ethanol as to the composite TVOC test gas. In practice, when ethanol vapor is present, it will drive up the TVOC reading significantly – the sensor can’t usually distinguish ethanol from other VOCs, but it will register a spike in “total VOC”. [support.atmotube.com], [enless-wireless.com] [support.atmotube.com]
So why use an “ethanol index” at all? In some advanced monitoring systems, the software does attempt to infer the dominance of certain VOC types. An “ethanol index” likely refers to a dimensionless ratio or level indicating ethanol-specific contribution. For instance, some algorithms compare sensor signals tuned to hydrogen (H₂) vs ethanol gas signatures to disentangle broad VOCs (this is how SGP30 estimates CO₂-equivalent vs VOC) – effectively giving an “alcohol VOC” reading separate from general outgassing. If the ethanol index > 0.50, the system triggers an alert, meaning ethanol vapors have exceeded a half-threshold that they consider significant. In plainer terms, a reading above 0.50 suggests a strong presence of ethanol-type VOC (likely from a recent use of sprays, solvents or disinfectants). This can be important because short-term bursts of ethanol might not push the total TVOC above 1000 ppb (especially in a large room), but still indicate a potentially hazardous scenario: for example, spraying a lot of alcohol-based cleaner in a poorly ventilated space can lead to dizziness or create a flammable vapor hazard even if total VOC is moderate.
Basis for the 0.50 Value: Unlike the TVOC ppb ranges, a specific “0.50” threshold is not a universally published standard but rather a heuristic from sensor manufacturers or facility engineers. It likely comes from empirical calibration – e.g., if 1.00 on that index corresponds to a high ethanol concentration (perhaps a predefined ppm level of ethanol), then 0.50 would be 50% of that high level. In absence of official standards purely for “ethanol in offices,” the threshold may be set to catch events that common guidelines don’t explicitly cover. Consider that occupational exposure limits for ethanol are much higher (in the UK and US, the workplace 8-hour limit for ethanol is ~1000 ppm = 1,880 mg/m³! [Manufactur...eet (MSDS)]), because those are designed to prevent severe toxicity or fire risk in industrial settings. But for general indoor air quality, one would never want anywhere near 1000 ppm of ethanol – even 10–50 ppm (which is 0.001–0.005 on a relative scale if 1.0=1000 ppm) can produce strong odor and mild irritation. Thus, an index of 0.5 is a very low threshold in absolute terms. It likely corresponds to ethanol in the low tens of ppm or even below, a level at which you’d smell it and possibly feel irritation but not reach regulatory hazard limits.
In practical terms, an ethanol index alarm helps differentiate VOC events:

If TVOC > 1000 ppb, you alarm because overall VOCs are high (many sources or a strong source – definitely poor air quality).
If TVOC is moderate (say 500 ppb) but ethanol index >0.5, you still alarm because that moderate total is largely coming from an ethanol spike (e.g. someone just heavily sprayed a cleaner). Why alert? Because even if other VOCs are low, a spike of solvent can cause acute effects (strong smell, transient irritation) and indicates an unusual event (perhaps a spill or overuse of a product) that a facility manager might want to know about. In essence, it’s an early warning for solvent-heavy events, supplementing the general TVOC alarm.

From a health perspective, ethanol is less toxic than many VOCs, but at high concentrations it can cause mucous membrane irritation, headache, and drowsiness. Very high ethanol vapor levels displace oxygen and are a fire/explosion risk. So monitoring it separately has safety merits. Many HVAC systems configured for demand-controlled ventilation will respond strongly to alcohol spikes – e.g., a building VOC sensor will show a sharp jump when ethyl alcohol is present and trigger the ventilation to ramp up. The sensor can’t tell “this is ethanol at X ppm” exactly, but it knows “VOC reading shot up – likely alcohol – ventilate now!”. The ethanol index is essentially making that logic explicit. [bapihvac.com]
In summary, the TVOC thresholds (good/moderate/alert) are grounded in international indoor air quality guidelines aimed at minimizing irritation and long-term health risks from combined VOC exposure. Different organizations’ numbers all converge to roughly a few hundred µg/m³ as “good” and around 1 mg/m³ as a point of concern. The ethanol index >0.5 criterion is an additional safeguard for specific types of VOC emissions (especially solvent/alcohol bursts) that are detected by modern sensors; it reflects the fact that sensors calibrate to ethanol and that ethanol-heavy events should trigger alerts even if total VOC isn’t off-the-charts. Both thresholds ultimately serve the same goal: maintaining healthy indoor air quality. Keeping TVOC in the “good” range (under a few hundred ppb) and minimising spikes of solvent VOCs will reduce the chance of adverse health effects like headaches, irritation, or longer-term organ damage, and will improve comfort and wellbeing for occupants.
