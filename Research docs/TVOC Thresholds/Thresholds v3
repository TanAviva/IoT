Certainly! Here's an even more granular breakdown of TVOC and ethanol index thresholds, using UK English and incorporating finer distinctions based on health guidance and sensor behaviour:

### **Highly Granular TVOC Thresholds and Descriptions**

| **Category**             | **TVOC Range (ppb)** | **Approx. µg/m³** | **Air Quality Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|----------------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ultra-clean              | 0 – 75               | 0 – ~0.37         | Pristine air quality; typical of outdoor rural environments or filtered cleanrooms         |
| Excellent                | 76 – 150             | ~0.38 – ~0.75     | Ideal indoor air; no detectable odours; optimal for sensitive individuals                  |
| Very Good                | 151 – 225            | ~0.76 – ~1.1      | Healthy indoor air; minimal VOC presence; no irritation expected                           |
| Good                    | 226 – 300            | ~1.1 – ~1.5       | Acceptable for all occupants; low risk of discomfort or complaints                         |
| Fair / Acceptable        | 301 – 450            | ~1.5 – ~2.2       | Slightly elevated VOCs; may be noticeable to sensitive individuals                         |
| Borderline Moderate      | 451 – 600            | ~2.2 – ~2.9       | VOCs present at noticeable levels; mild odours or irritation possible                      |
| Moderate                 | 601 – 750            | ~2.9 – ~3.7       | Air quality declining; ventilation recommended; symptoms may begin in sensitive groups     |
| Elevated / Warning Zone  | 751 – 1000           | ~3.7 – ~4.9       | VOCs approaching unhealthy levels; complaints likely; urgent ventilation advised           |
| Poor / Alert             | 1001 – 2000          | ~4.9 – ~9.8       | High VOC concentration; strong odours and irritation; unsafe for prolonged exposure        |
| Very Poor / Hazardous    | 2001 – 3000          | ~9.8 – ~14.7      | Serious indoor pollution; acute symptoms likely; immediate action required                 |
| Severe / Unacceptable    | > 3000               | > ~14.7           | Dangerous air quality; potential toxic exposure; evacuate or ventilate immediately         |

### **Highly Granular Ethanol Index Thresholds and Descriptions**

| **Ethanol Index Value** | **Description**                                                                 |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0.00 – 0.10              | Baseline ethanol; typical of unoccupied or well-ventilated spaces              |
| 0.11 – 0.20              | Trace ethanol; may result from human respiration or minor product use          |
| 0.21 – 0.30              | Light ethanol presence; low-level cleaning or sanitiser use                    |
| 0.31 – 0.40              | Moderate ethanol; noticeable odour possible; ventilation may be beneficial     |
| 0.41 – 0.50              | Elevated ethanol; likely from sprays or solvents; approaching alert threshold  |
| 0.51 – 0.65              | Alert level; strong ethanol presence; may cause irritation or odour complaints |
| 0.66 – 0.80              | High ethanol; recent heavy use of alcohol-based products; ventilation needed   |
| 0.81 – 1.00              | Very high ethanol; potential health and safety concern; urgent action advised  |
| > 1.00                   | Excessive ethanol; possible spill or misuse; risk of flammability or toxicity  |

Let me know if you'd like these thresholds visualised in a chart or compared against specific building standards like WELL, RESET, or LEED. I can also help you explore how these thresholds are used in sensor calibration or building automation systems.
