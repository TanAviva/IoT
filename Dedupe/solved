To need to install Visual c++ build tools, just get DNS blockage removed:

conda create -n old-dedupe python=3.10

conda activate old-dedupe

(old-dedupe) C:\Users\Tanlocal> pip install dedupe==1.10.0

=============

conda deactivate


=========

Option 2: If You Must Use dedupe==1.10.0
If you are working on an old project and you absolutely must have version 1.10.0, you cannot use it with Python 3.12. You must use an older version of Python.

The best way to do this is with a new Conda environment.

Create a new environment with an older Python (e.g., Python 3.10):

Bash

conda create -n old-dedupe python=3.10
Activate the new environment:

Bash

conda activate old-dedupe
Install the old version inside this new environment (where Python is 3.10):

Bash

(old-dedupe) C:\Users\Tanlocal> pip install dedupe==1.10.0
This will work because Python 3.10 still has the longintrepr.h file that dedupe==1.10.0 needs.


================

Here is an analysis of your terminal output.

The installation of the `dedupe` package is failing because it and its dependencies (like `affinegap`, `dedupe-Levenshtein-search`, and `dedupe-hcluster`) require C++ code to be compiled during installation, and your system is missing the necessary compiler.

-----

## Breakdown of Attempts

You made several attempts to install the package, each failing for a related reason:

1.  **`pip install dedupe` (Latest Version):**

      * **What happened:** `pip` tried to install the latest version (`dedupe-3.0.3`). This version has dependencies that need to be "built" from source code.
      * **Why it failed:** The build process for `affinegap` and `dedupe-Levenshtein-search` stopped, reporting the same error: **`error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required.`**

2.  **`conda install -c conda-forge dedupe`:**

      * **What happened:** You correctly tried to use `conda` from the `conda-forge` channel, which often provides pre-compiled packages (avoiding the C++ error).
      * **Why it failed:** The command resulted in a **`PackagesNotFoundError`**. This means `conda-forge` does not have a `dedupe` package that is compatible with your specific environment, most likely your Python version (which appears to be **Python 3.12** based on the `cp312` in the `pip` logs).

3.  **`pip install dedupe==1.10.0` (Older Version):**

      * **What happened:** You tried an older version of `dedupe`, hoping it might not have the same build requirements.
      * **Why it failed:** This older version *still* requires C++ extensions to be compiled (for `dedupe`, `affinegap`, `dedupe-hcluster`, etc.). It failed with the exact same error: **`error: Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 or greater is required.`**

4.  **`pip install --upgrade pip`:**

      * **What happened:** You successfully upgraded `pip`.
      * **Why it failed (on retry):** Upgrading `pip` was a good troubleshooting step, but it doesn't solve the core problem. The problem isn't with `pip` itself, but with the missing system compiler. Your final attempt after the upgrade failed for the same reason.

-----

## ðŸ’¡ The Core Problem: Missing C++ Compiler

The central issue is that `dedupe` and its dependencies use C extensions for better performance. `pip` tries to build these extensions from source code, but it needs the **Microsoft C++ Build Tools** to do so. Since you're on Windows and don't have this installed, the build fails.

The `conda` attempt failed because the `conda-forge` channel likely doesn't have a pre-built version of `dedupe` for the new Python 3.12.

-----

## âœ… Recommended Solutions

You have two main options to fix this. The first one is the cleanest and most recommended for Anaconda users.

### Solution 1: (Recommended) Use a New Conda Environment

The easiest and safest way to fix this is to create a new Anaconda environment with an older, more compatible version of Python (like 3.10 or 3.11), for which `conda-forge` *does* have the pre-compiled packages.

1.  Open your Anaconda Prompt.
2.  Create a new environment (e.g., named `dedupe-env`) with Python 3.10:
    ```bash
    conda create -n dedupe-env python=3.10
    ```
3.  Activate the new environment:
    ```bash
    conda activate dedupe-env
    ```
4.  Now, install `dedupe` from `conda-forge` (inside this new environment):
    ```bash
    conda install -c conda-forge dedupe
    ```

This should work because `conda` will download pre-built binaries, completely bypassing the C++ compiler error.

### Solution 2: Install the C++ Build Tools

If you must use your current `(base)` environment and Python 3.12, your only option is to install the build tools as the error message suggests.

1.  Go to the URL from the error message: [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
2.  Download and run the installer.
3.  When the installer launches, make sure you select the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload.
4.  After the installation is complete, **restart your terminal** and try the `pip install dedupe` command again.

===============

This is a new and different error, but it's good news: **your C++ build tools are working correctly\!**

This new problem is a **version incompatibility**.

-----

## Analysis of the New Error

Here's a simple breakdown of what's happening:

1.  **The Target:** You are trying to install `dedupe==1.10.0`, which is an older version.
2.  **The Environment:** Your Anaconda environment is using **Python 3.12** (we know this from the `cp312` and `cpython-312` in the logs).
3.  **The Conflict:** The `dedupe==1.10.0` source code requires a C-level Python file named `longintrepr.h`.
4.  **The Error:** Your C++ compiler correctly reports `fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'longintrepr.h'`.

This is because the **`longintrepr.h` file was removed in Python 3.12**. The old `dedupe` code you are trying to install is not compatible with the new version of Python you are using.

The fact that `dedupe-hcluster` and `Levenshtein_search` *did* successfully build confirms that your C++ compiler is installed and working perfectly. The build is only failing for the main `dedupe` package because its code is too old.

-----

## Your Solutions

You have two main paths forward, depending on your goal.

### Option 1: (Recommended) Use the Latest `dedupe`

If your goal is to just use `dedupe`, the easiest solution is to install the latest version, which *is* compatible with Python 3.12.

You mentioned you were able to install it after installing the build tools. You should just use that working version.

```bash
# This will install the latest version (like 3.0.3)
# which is compatible with Python 3.12
pip install dedupe
```

### Option 2: If You *Must* Use `dedupe==1.10.0`

If you are working on an old project and you absolutely *must* have version `1.10.0`, you **cannot** use it with Python 3.12. You must use an older version of Python.

The best way to do this is with a new Conda environment.

1.  **Create a new environment** with an older Python (e.g., Python 3.10):
    ```bash
    conda create -n old-dedupe python=3.10
    ```
2.  **Activate the new environment:**
    ```bash
    conda activate old-dedupe
    ```
3.  **Install the old version** inside this new environment (where Python is 3.10):
    ```bash
    (old-dedupe) C:\Users\Tanlocal> pip install dedupe==1.10.0
    ```

This will work because Python 3.10 still has the `longintrepr.h` file that `dedupe==1.10.0` needs.

-----

Do you need to use this specific older version, or will the latest version (which you can successfully install) work for you?
