To need to install Visual c++ build tools, just get DNS blockage removed:

conda create -n old-dedupe python=3.10

conda activate old-dedupe

(old-dedupe) C:\Users\Tanlocal> pip install dedupe==1.10.0

=============

conda deactivate


=========

Option 2: If You Must Use dedupe==1.10.0
If you are working on an old project and you absolutely must have version 1.10.0, you cannot use it with Python 3.12. You must use an older version of Python.

The best way to do this is with a new Conda environment.

Create a new environment with an older Python (e.g., Python 3.10):

Bash

conda create -n old-dedupe python=3.10
Activate the new environment:

Bash

conda activate old-dedupe
Install the old version inside this new environment (where Python is 3.10):

Bash

(old-dedupe) C:\Users\Tanlocal> pip install dedupe==1.10.0
This will work because Python 3.10 still has the longintrepr.h file that dedupe==1.10.0 needs.
